E. Tata Tertib Akademik:

Academic rules generally apply to all courses in the Faculty of Art and Design:
1. Following student discipline and academic sanctions in the university Student Guide book.
2. If a policy or adjustment is needed, it can be described in the lecture contract.

Lecture Contract:

    1.	Learning activities begin at 8:30 WIB right.
    2.	During the learning process cellphone is turned off / silent. Students are not permitted to use / play cellphones in class.
    3.	Submission of assignments is set according to the schedule. For those who are late get a value of 0%.
    4.	Students who work on assignments and examinations by other students are asked to resign on the on going semester and can take part in the next semester (if any)
    5.	The counting tool that is permitted is a calculator, it is not permitted to use the cellphone both in class and during exams (strictly prohibited!!)
    6.	Rules for the minimum amount of attendance in learning remain in force (75% attendance), including rules for how to dress or wear shoes.
Note:
Sanctions are discussed and agreed upon in the lecture contract at the beginning of the lecture.
